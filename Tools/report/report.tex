This task was reasonably straighforward, though we did run into a few small issues when we implemented later tasks, and we had to return and handle some edge cases in the \verb|SSAVisitor| class. These were mainly to do with variables we introduced in predication, and the `free' variables we introduced when handling \verb|havoc| statements.

In terms of implementation, we simply kept a record (using a \verb|Map|) of the current number of assignments to each variable, starting with 0 when the variable is declared. We then just needed to append the character `\$', and this recorded number every time we encountered a reference to the variable. Upon reaching an assignment statement, we first handled the right-hand side of the assignment \emph{before} incrementing assignment count - to account for cases where the assignment may reference the variable itself (eg. \verb|x = x + 1|).

The problems we encountered with the variables we had introduced were solved with a check for the character `\$', which we would use in our variables.
