\section{SSA Renaming}

This task was reasonably straightforward, though we did run into a few small issues when we implemented later tasks, and we had to return and handle some edge cases in the \verb|SSAVisitor| class. These were mainly to do with variables we introduced in predication, and the `free' variables we introduced when handling \verb|havoc| statements.

In terms of implementation, we simply kept a record (using a \verb|Map|) of the current number of assignments to each variable, starting with 0 when the variable is declared. We then just needed to append the character `\$', and this recorded number every time we encountered a reference to the variable. Upon reaching an assignment statement, we first handled the right-hand side of the assignment \emph{before} incrementing assignment count - to account for cases where the assignment may reference the variable itself (eg. \verb|x = x + 1|).

The problems we encountered with the variables we had introduced were solved with a check for the character `\$', which we would use in our variables.

\section{Predication}

The workhorse in our implementation of Predicated Execution is our scope stack. This stack initially contains the Global predicate, then each time a conditional is entered, the predicate for its satisfaction is pushed onto the stack. Similarly, when the conditional body is left this Predicate is popped off the stack.

Pushing the Global Predicate to the stack initially allows us to simply \verb|peek| at the top element when predicating a statement.

Every assignment statement (including those of new predicates), is predicated using the ternary operator with both the latest version of the global predicate and the conditional predicate on the top of our scope stack. If the predicate fails, then the assignment will return the original variable value (equivalent to a no-op), otherwise the assignment will succeed.

As previously stated, when we predicate a statement we use both the global predicate and the predicate on top of the stack - even though the topmost predicate should include the global predicate anyway. This is to take into account any \verb|assume| statements we encounter inside a conditional branch. The \verb|assume| will change the global predicate, and we decided that it was much less complicated to simply include both predicates instead of altering everything in the stack. As a consequence of this, when we are not in a conditional branch the predicate is duplicated (eg. \verb|(G$0 && G$0)|), though this does not affect the outcome.

TODO: Talk about \verb|havoc()| and \verb|assume()|

\section{Bounded Model Checking}

Did we do anything extra than the notes?

\section{Verification Mode}

Did we do anything extra than the notes?

For Houdini we decided to compute invariant fixed points for all the loops in the program simultaneously.
We made this decision because only top-level sequential loop invariants would not \emph{need} to be proved
this way. Wheras any loop nested inside another loop would have co-dependent invariants with its parent. \\

If we take look at Figure 1 for example. We have five loops, with loops \verb|1|, \verb|2| and \verb|5| occuring
sequentially on the top level, and loops \verb|3| and \verb|4| nested inside loop \verb|2|. We can compute
invariants for loop \verb|1| without any of the other loops, because its invariants are not dependent on any
others. But the invariants for loop \verb|2|, \verb|3| and \verb|4| need to be computed simultaneously, because
they are part of a cycle in the invariant dependency graph. We could then compute invariants for loop \verb|5|
in isolation. \\

We decided to simply compute the invariants of all loops simultaneously, even though this would mean spending more
time in the sat solver (5 sets of loop invariants to compute, and worse case exponential complexity of SAT solver).
In practice, for small simpleC programs the overhead required to compute the dependency graph, and run through multiple
fixed point computations would take longer than the time saved in the SAT solver, especially since exponential is worst
case complexity, and will be much lower in practice.

\subsection{Nested Loops}

When proving invariants of nested loops, we must verify the outer loop simultaneously with any interior loops. This is because the invariants of each loop are dependent on each other. (This gon be reel complicated)

\section{Invgen Mode}

Our invariant generation algorithm is reasonably smart, in that the integers it considers are only the ones which appear in the program itself (unlike the more `brute force' approach seen in lectures, and TODO: in Daikon? This was pretty easy to impliment - as the visitor parses the program to find variable names, it also picks up any integers. This works well for our simple examples, though we have also included a invariant addition and subtraction template to cope with some of the cases where our approach might not be enough.

We were not able to optimise this mode to any great degree, partly due to the nature of the simple C language. For example, we cannot eliminate candidate invariants with mismatched types, because there is only one type for variables in the language. We considered reducing the number of invariants generated through suppression of weaker invariants, and finding dynamically constant variables. However, in the end we decided that the time spent finding these invariants would likely be greater than the time houdini would spend running the program with one or two more candidates. Since the invariants would likely not even be seen by a user, returning faster but with unnecessary invariants seems like a fair tradeoff. TODO: does it, though?
