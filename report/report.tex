\subsection{Eliminating ``null'' warnings}

One of the interesting things about this bit is the order of comment annotations.

initially we tried:

\begin{verbatim}
  /* invariant \nonnullelements(seatReservations)
  /*@ non_null */
  private final Customer[][] seatReservations;
\end{verbatim}

This actually created 2 warnings regarding assigning null to fields of seatReservations. It seems that the
\verb|non_null| comment annotation overwrote the invariant annotation. Switching the order to:
\begin{verbatim}
  /*@ non_null */
  /* invariant \nonnullelements(seatReservations)
\end{verbatim}
fixed removed the warnings.

\subsection{Eliminating ``negative length'' warnings}

There were only 2 warnings about negative length.

\begin{verbatim}
  10:  seatReservations = new Customer[rowToIndex(Seat.MAX_ROW) + 1]
  11:                                 [numberToIndex(Seat.MAX_NUMBER) + 1];
\end{verbatim}

This was solved by annotating rowToIndex and numberToIndex as helper functions. ESC Java
will inline the function body, essentially translating the 2 above lines into:
\begin{verbatim}
  10:  seatReservations = new Customer[(Seat.MAX_ROW - Seat.MIN_ROW) + 1]
  11:                                 [(Seat.MAX_NUMBER - Seat.MIN_NUMBER) + 1];
\end{verbatim}

Suprisingly, \verb|(Seat.MAX_ROW - Seat.MIN_ROW) + 1| and \verb|(Seat.MAX_NUMBER - Seat.MIN_NUMBER) + 1| turn
out to be positive numbers. So the warning disappears.

\subsection{Eliminating ``negative array index'' warnings}

These cases were all very similar, and were related to the two fields (row, number) of the Seat class. To solve them, we first gave the getters post-conditions that ensured their values were in an acceptable range (Seat.MIN\_ROW, MAX\_ROW; Seat.MIN\_NUMBER, MAX\_NUMBER). This required two other changes - we made gave invariants to both row and number, and preconditions to their setters. We also made the indexToNumber() and indexToRow() functions into helpers.
